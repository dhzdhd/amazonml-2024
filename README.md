# Amazon ML challenge

We used the [PaliGemma model](https://github.com/dhzdhd/amazonml-2024/blob/master/app/notebooks/paligemma.ipynb) for inference with [regex postprocessing of the outputs](https://github.com/dhzdhd/amazonml-2024/blob/master/app/src/postprocess.py)
The results for a sample are in the [result folder](https://github.com/dhzdhd/amazonml-2024/tree/master/app/result)
